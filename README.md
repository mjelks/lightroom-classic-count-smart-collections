# Count Smart Collections Lightroom Classic Plugin
Simple Plugin used to count the number of images folders inside a top level collection.

In my exact use case, the top level collection can be found in **Film Scans**.
Then I would like a count of all Smart Collections under **Film Scans** --> **Processed**
